= zenhub-bulk-issuer

Bulk-creates ZenHub issues to all repositories in a workspace, optionally assigning them to sprints and/or epics.

== Usage

`cargo run -- --help`

== API schema

We use ZenHub's private API, since their public API (https://github.com/ZenHubIO/API) is missing a lot of resources
(especially, sprints) and bulk operations.

To update the schema:

1. Put your authn token into `zenhub-schema-fetcher/codegen.yml` (DO NOT COMMIT THIS)
2. Run `code zenhub-schema-fetcher && yarn install && yarn graphql-code-generator`

We need to patch graphql to reduce the introspection query depth, since we'd otherwise be hitting ZenHub's depth cap.
